    <p>
        ARF is instrumental in the world of animal rescue/rehab/re-home because we have an <strong>AMAZING</strong> team of volunteers. We are always looking for responsible individuals/families to help us during various fundraising events, and of course can always use new additions to our successful Foster Home Program.

    <p>
        Before you complete the volunteer application please consider certain aspects of volunteering on any animal rescue <strong>TEAM</strong>. All volunteers have different personalities and beliefs, and yet we all come together with one goal: to save lives. The ARF team welcomes friendly personalities and open minds, new ideas and positive attitudes. We are driven by the knowledge there is suffering to end, and an ARF volunteer doesn't just talk the talk, we walk the walk.
