    We are the <strong>Animal Rescue Foundation of Ontario.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    ARF Ontario works with local First Nations areas and rural communities in Ontario to <strong>rescue, rehabilitate, and re-home</strong> stray dogs and cats by community member request. ARF Ontario is based in London, Ontario, formed
    by long-time ARF Alberta volunteers.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
    ARF Ontario receives no government grants and operates completely on <a ui-sref="contact.donate">donations</a> from fellow animal lovers, adoption fees, and fundraising projects developed by our volunteers. We are a 100% volunteer, grassroots organization
    and are not a registered charity. The majority of our expenses go towards essential veterinary care, training, and supplies. While all dogs and cats require vaccinations, spay/neutering, de-worming, quality food &amp; TLC, most
    of them also require extensive veterinary procedures and consultations with trainers.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
    ARF has an <strong>honesty policy:</strong> the full history, including all medical information, of an animal is given to potential adopters before a decision to adopt has been made. We want families, and their new furry friends, to be
    happy and safe for life.
