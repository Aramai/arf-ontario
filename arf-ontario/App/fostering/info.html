        Thank you for your interest in the Animal Rescue Foundation and in becoming an ARF Foster Parent!
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
        Please watch the following video and read the page  below which provides a basic outline of the responsibilities associated with fostering. Please realize that these dogs are rescued in the true sense of the word and they need your commitment and care to see them through to their permanent homes. Once you have decided that you do in fact wish to volunteer as an ARF Foster Parent, please complete the <a ui-sref="fostering.apply">foster home application form</a>.

        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>
                When we first receive a dog, he/she is placed in a "holding area" to first assess the animal's health. From here, the dog is placed in a foster home. Crates are provided for the dogs and we strongly encourage our foster homes to use them.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the dog has not been fully vaccinated, please minimize contact with other dogs and keep them on your property and away from off-leash parks, especially during the initial 14 day quarantine period. This two week period of time allows us to evaluate the dog's health and behavior. - Please supervise the dog carefully when in your yard to prevent any attempts to escape.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, ARF vaccinates and deworms all animals in our care (and surgically alters dogs over 5 months of age). An adoption envelope will be provided with each dog which will indicate the vaccination and deworming schedule and you will be responsible for ensuring that any necessary treatments are performed when due.
            </p>

        <div class="panel-heading">Training (House Training, Leash Walking)</div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>
                Training of the dog will be done using <strong>POSITIVE RE-ENFORCEMENT methods ONLY</strong>. ARF does not use any training devices (i.e. choke collars) or any form of Force training (i.e. alpha role, muzzle grabs). Foster homes are encouraged to attend the classes our trainer conducts in order to learn more about positive training and the rewards of its long term effects on the behavioral health of the canines. Our trainer is always available to help you learn more about the programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                While you are fostering an ARF dog, you may expect to receive calls or emails from more than one ARF volunteer. Note that we have many areas of responsibility throughout ARF and volunteers may be contacting you at various times as part of their responsibilities.

        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>
                ARF has a network in place which will ensure that the dog finds an adopting home. All applications coming into the adoption coordinator are screened. Suitable candidates will be given your name and number (but not your address) in order to contact you to arrange an appointment should they wish to see the dog in your care. It is <strong>VERY</strong> important for foster homes to be available by phone and/or e-mail to ARF's adoption coordinator during the adoption process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being prompt with returning calls/e-mail to potential adopters is important to the ultimate goal of placing the animals in their forever homes, while also maintaining ARF's responsible image. Potential homes are also found through visits to our website and by showing our dogs at various pet supply locations. In all cases, when you meet the potential adopter, it is important to try and determine if the dog would be a good match for the home and vice versa. We encourage you to do additional screening, once the adopter comes to see the dog in your home. As the foster parent, you have a lot of input as to who the new guardian will be.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have approved the new owner of the dog, the potential adopter must wait 24 hours to pick up the dog. As well, adoption and training contracts must be completed. This should be filled out together with the adopter to ensure agreement on all points. The adoption fee and completed forms are then delivered to ARF or picked up by ARF (along with collar, leashes, crates, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Please note that potential adopters must first be screened by our Adoption Coordinator.</strong>

        <div class="panel-heading">Common Questions</div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>ARF foster homes have access to a wonderful support group of veteran Foster Homes and General Volunteers. You are able to email or call those who will assist you with any questions you have during your first foster experience.</p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                    <strong>What if we fall in love with the animal and want to adopt?</strong>
                    <br />
                        If you are a first time foster home – plan NOT to adopt your first foster. It is best to go through the fostering process once, send the animal to their new home, and then save another life. Once you’ve let the first one go, the process becomes much easier. However, if you do feel with your second foster (or any after the first) that this might be the one that is meant to stay in your forever home, please contact the adoption coordinator and go through the adoption interview BEFORE she has begun interviewing other potential homes.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How long will the animal stay in my home?</strong>
                        <br />
                        This really varies. ALL animals are in the ARF system for a minimum of 14 days. After the initial two weeks you and the Foster Home Coordinator/Adoption Coordinator decide if the animal is ready for it's new home. Is the animal house-trained? If not, then more work is needed before adoption. The animal should have basic training completed before going to a new home. A cat should be using the litter box 100% of the time, and a dog should be house-trained. On average, kittens – three to four weeks, cats – three months, puppies – three weeks, adult dogs – three months.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What if I’m going to be late from work and the dog needs to go out for a walk?</strong>
                        <br />
                        You have access to dog walkers on your contact list. Call one of the volunteers to assist. If none are available, call a trusted friend, or a fellow foster parent that may live close by. If all avenues have been exhausted, get in touch with the Foster Home Coordinator.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>I’m going away for holidays in two weeks; can I still take a foster?</strong>
                        <br />
                        Always let the Foster Home Coordinator know <strong>BEFORE</strong> the animal is placed in your home if you are planning on taking a trip in the near future. Possibly, you will be a temporary spot before the animal goes to a different foster home, or we will simply wait until you return to get you your next foster animal. If you have a long-term foster animal, contact the sitters on your list (i.e. for a cat to be checked daily) or discuss with the Foster Home Coordinator the possibility of temporary transfer to a different foster home. A weekend away does not really qualify for a full foster switch, so you do have the option of arranging care through fellow volunteers directly or to pay for the bordatella shot in the animal and then pay for the boarding facility or professional pet sitter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Do I pay for the pet food?</strong>
                        <br />
                        ARF always provides the commercial pet food and the brands depend upon what we get donated. If you are not happy with the donated food, then you are allowed to purchase the brand you prefer (at your expense).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What do I do if the animal gets sick?</strong>
                        <br />
                        Emergency vet care, thankfully, is very rare. For a life threatening emergency, try to immediately get a hold of the Foster Home Coordinator. If you cannot reach them (which would be rare) phone The Strathroy Animal Clinic immediately, identify yourself as an ARF foster parent, and ask for help.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>I think I’m going to faint at the sight of fleas. Can I request a bug-free animal?</strong>
                        <br />
                        Every single animal that arrives in our care will have some form of intestinal worms. <strong>NO</strong> you cannot get them, and <strong>NO</strong> your resident animal will not get them. The worms are given through the consumption of a “carrier” which would be i.e. a bird or mouse.
                        The animal has almost always been dewormed once before it arrives so expect to see a couple of icky poops. A second deworming usually happens two weeks later & again, some ickies may appear. These dogs were STRAYS living outdoors so of course there will be external parasites such as fleas. Be ready to give the animal a bath when it arrives at your home. Call or e-mail your foster home team for assurance that you will not faint and all will be well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What if the animal is just not a good fit for our home?</strong>
                        <br />
                        Before accepting any animal think long and hard about the commitment you are agreeing to. A move from a foster home is very stressful on the animal and a lot of work for your fellow volunteers. <strong>PLEASE</strong> try to persevere until a permanent home is found. If there is just no way you can continue (i.e. if there has been an aggressive incident, which is rare) please contact the Managing Director to discuss. It will be your responsibility to transfer the animal to the new spot unless there is danger in doing so.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Can I take the animal to a different vet other than Strathroy?</strong>
                        <br />
                        All vet appointments are arranged through the Foster Home Coordinator & the Strathroy clinic is the only veterinarian used by ARF. <strong>ALL VET CARE is at ARF’S EXPENSE.</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>I have purchased toys for the animals; can I send them to the adoptive home?</strong>
                        <br />
                        Absolutely! However, all ARF inventories remains as such. All required supplies will be provided at ARF’s expense.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Is it mandatory for the foster home to crate train the dogs?</strong>
                        <br />
                        Yes. Dogs <strong>MUST</strong> be crated when unsupervised. Puppies must be crate trained before their adoption. Any damage done in the home is your responsibility – crate training makes damage much, much less likely. A crate is provided to you at ARF’s expense.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Will there be financial compensation of any sort if we choose to buy something for the dog that has not been donated? (i.e. doggie bed)</strong>
                        <br />
                        No. If you require a necessity please speak to the Foster Home Coordinator to see what is available. Any extra purchases you choose will be at your own expense (and many tail wags are always the reward!)
